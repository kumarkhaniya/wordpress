No, there's absolutely no need for you to write even a line of code or know how to publish an app. Our expert team will take care of all the hard work required to publish your app and is available for small customizations.

= Do the apps update automatically? =
Yes, any new content, changes in the app configuration or design will be reflected automatically in your app!

MobiLoud News is designed for news and blog publishers, meaning you can build a truly native mobile app with all the typical features of popular News apps like CNN, BBC, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed or TechCrunch.

With MobiLoud Canvas you can turn your existing website (responsive or mobile optimized) into native apps, adding Push Notifications, Offline support, a native menu and more.

= How much does it cost? =
The plugin is free to install for our customers. It's a key component of our services. Check the [pricing plans on MobiLoud.com](https://www.mobiloud.com/pricing/?ref=plugindesc).

= What functionality will my News app offer? =
Your News app will automatically show the latest content from your site, with no need for you to update it manually. Your app will display posts and pages, comments and categories. Your users will be able to read content online and offline, share it with a single tap, save their favourites, leave comments on your articles and, most importantly, receive push notifications alerting them to new content.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfSzVeA_oaM]

= Are push notifications supported? = 
Push notifications are a key feature of mobile apps, something a site on its own cannot offer. They're a fantastic subscription mechanism that can really help you drive growth and traffic over time. With MobiLoud you can send notifications automatically whenever you post new content (with optional filters) or manually, whenever you want. You can also attach a page or post to your notification, so you can use them for anything: alert your users to a new event, promotion or send urgent and important updates - it's a direct connection with your users!

Watch the video below for an overview of the push notifications features.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ZCNFpRPT8]

= Can I show my pages or an external URL in the app? =
Your site is built with pages rather than articles? No problem, you can set a page as your mobile app's home screen, add pages to the app's menu and allow your users to easily navigate a whole hierarchy of pages. Use it to build apps for a company site, catalogues and any sort of reference apps.

Beyond pages and articles, you can now use any URL as your app's home screen or as an entry in your mobile app's menu. Use it to embed functionality from any web app into your app, like forms, widgets or your profile on social networks, the possibilities are endless!

= Are image galleries supported? =
Image galleries are supported natively, with a simple design that enhances your photography and lets the user quickly browse your images.

Users can swipe between images, save or share them and quickly get an overview of all the images you attached to your articles.

= Can I modify the code or add my own CSS? =
Sure, click on Settings/Editor to add your own HTML/PHP/CSS code and customise the contents and looks of your mobile app's screens. You can easily pull in content from custom fields and add any functionality and styling adjustments you need.

Watch the video below for an overview.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgdDD6uCWQ]

= Are custom fields supported? =
Yes, you can easily add custom fields to the article list (one field supported) or anywhere and in any number within the content of posts or pages. You can add your own code using our Editor, or we can help you out with that!

With MobiLoud you have the ability to add any custom code to your mobile app’s post/page layout. Just click on MobiLoud in your WordPress admin dashboard, select Settings and then click on the Editor tab.

Would you like to submit your own mobile app? That’s possible too.

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments in your mobile app in place of the standard WordPress commenting system. You can change these settings from the MobiLoud / Settings / Content screen.

= Can I use my own Apple or Google Play account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= Is there a long term contract? =
No contracts here! You pay month-to-month, and if you're unhappy with the service, you can simply cancel by emailing us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com). Simple. No risk.

= What are the Terms and Conditions? =
Here are our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.mobiloud.com/terms/?ref=plugindesc) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.mobiloud.com/privacy/?ref=plugindesc).


= What is a native mobile app? =
MobiLoud News apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience. Native mobile apps are fast, run smoothly on the mobile devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A mobile app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!
